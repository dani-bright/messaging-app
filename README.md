# Messaging app

messaging app using next and nest

### Run project

- `docker-compose up`

## Possible improvements 

### Inbox features

avoid pulling all the relations from user everytime just to manage messages in front. Another solutions would be to write a more precise query using a querybuilder or create a route to get all messages then manage everything on the client part.

### Next
first time using next. this is probably not the best way to work with it. Ness to read some documentation

### Rendering
a little bit too much rendering. consider adding more memoization


### More to come
- multiple receivers on message
